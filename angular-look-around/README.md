What we're going to do ?
=======================

It'll be a simple application using Google maps API to load the location service and find the nearest ATM,Bar,Hotels, Pubs ..etc. Google is already
providing this information on their Google+ page –– but as I said earlier, we'll be mimicking the same for our learning purpose.

Technologies/Frameworks used here :
======================

- Angular JS
- Google Maps API
- Twitter bootstrap
- TDD ( Karma runner )
- Yeoman ( Optional now )
