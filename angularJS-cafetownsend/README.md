# CafeTownsend - AngularJS

<br/>
This project is an HTML5/Javascript implementation of the infamous CafeTownsend application. CafeTownsend is a well known application created to demonstrate various MVC frameworks using Flex or ActionScript. There are known ports using Cairngorm, Mate, PureMVC, Spring ActionScript, RobotLegs and Swiz. 

This project contributes a superior port of the HTML5 CafeTownsend application;using the [Angular.js IoC](http://angularjs.org/) framework.

AngularJS is an amazing IoC MVVM framework for Javascript applications. Supporting pageless architectures, advanced data binding, HTML templating, and dependency injectionâ€¦ AngularJS is strikingly similar to the Flex [Swiz IoC framework](http://swizframework.org/).


Note: Subsequent CSS version will be rewritten in [{Less}](http://lesscss.org/) for dynamic stylesheet language support. <br/>
The AngularJS port also demonstrates significant advantages over the SpineJS implementation:

*  Pageless Architecture
*  Improved routing with `deep link` support
*  Significant reduction in HTML template fragments
*  Rigorous elimination of Javascript code from HTML 
*  Inter-controller data sharing
*  Session Management/Authentication
*  Lazy loading of data services (*with auto-jsonify of external JSON data*)
*  Code versions handwritten in both Javascript and Coffeescript 
*  Demonstrates `separation-of-concerns` for Model-Views-Controllers
*  Demonstates `dependency injection` for services and Controllers
*  Demonstrates best practices for `Model-View-View-Model (MVVM)` architectures
*  Uses [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) files for services and controller classes

## Build Notes


Developers should use the cake script to build, consolidate, and minify the custom Javascript into Cafetownsend.min.js

    cd ./src; cake build;

*  CafeTownsend.js - consolidate application code
*  bootstrap.js    - asynch loader and initializer (using head.js)

## Pending Features

This effort is still ongoing with some in-progress effort that will provide the following features:

*  Provide `loading indicator` as data load indicator
*  Support deep linking with synch data loads
*  Convert disorganized CSS to LESS
*  Build CafeTownsend Tests/Scenarios
*  Create view slide transitions
